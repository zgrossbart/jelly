					This page is written using HTML canvas and <a href="http://paperjs.org/">PaperJS</a>.  Everything swimming here was programmatically generated and is different each time.  The jellyfish you're looking at right now were made just for you and they will never exist exactly the same way again.  Refresh the page and get totally different jellyfish every time.
