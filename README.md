Jellyfish
==================================================


This project is an animation of jellyfish using [PaperJS](http://www.paperjs.org).  It was adapted from the amazing work of the very talented [Ricardo Sanchez](http://nardove.com/).

This project is a great sample of complex animations using HTML canvas.  The code is relatively simple and has a lot of comments.  

If you want to play with it just clone the repository and open the `index.html` page in your favorite browser.
